# Prompt for OpenAI to Enhance 8gentc Integration Plan

## Context
I'm building the 8gentc Platform, a business planning tool with AI capabilities. The application currently has a sophisticated UI scaffold but minimal functionality. I have an integration plan to transform it into a fully functional platform, but I need your assistance to enhance it based on some research findings.

## Current Status
The current application is a Next.js project with:
- A simulated authentication system using cookies
- A UI structure with login page and main application layout
- No real backend, database, or AI integration
- UI components for displaying business plans, goals, and timelines
- Canvas visualizations (Node, Mermaid, Text views)

## Integration Plan Summary
My current plan involves:
1. Setting up Supabase for database and authentication
2. Creating API routes for CRUD operations
3. Integrating OpenAI for AI functionality
4. Implementing proper data persistence per user
5. Enhancing the UI with loading states and visualization rendering

## Primary Focus Areas
My immediate priorities are:

1. **Proper Authentication System**: Implementing a robust, secure authentication system that works with Next.js
2. **AI Chat Functionality**: Creating a sophisticated chat interface with:
   - Context management across different planning sections (Context, Goals, Timelines)
   - Caching and persisting conversation data per user
   - Maintaining conversation history and context when switching between sections
3. **Visualization Generation**: Using AI to generate and manage:
   - Node graph visualizations
   - Mermaid diagrams
   - Formatted business plan text
4. **Data Persistence**: Ensuring user data, conversations, and generated content are properly stored and retrievable

## Secondary Considerations
While not immediate priorities, the system should be architected to allow for these future features:
- Real-time collaboration (multi-user editing)
- Advanced sharing capabilities
- Multi-project management

## Research Findings to Incorporate
Recent research has provided detailed technical insights that should be incorporated into the plan:

1. **Authentication Options**: The research specifically recommends NextAuth.js/Auth.js or Clerk with built-in JWT/cookie sessions, OAuth/Social login, MFA, and security best practices out-of-the-box. These would integrate with middleware/route guards to protect API endpoints.

2. **Database Schema**: The research provides a detailed Prisma schema for:
   ```prisma
   model User {
     id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     email     String   @unique
     name      String?
     projects  Project[]
     createdAt DateTime @default(now())
   }

   model Project {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     owner     User    @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
     ownerId   Int
     title     String
     nodes     Node[]
     edges     Edge[]
     plan      Plan?
     createdAt DateTime @default(now())
   }

   model Node {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     project   Project @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
     projectId Int
     label     String
     x         Float?
     y         Float?
     // other properties...
   }

   model Edge {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     project   Project @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
     projectId Int
     from      Node    @relation("EdgeFrom", fields: [fromId], references: [id])
     fromId    Int
     to        Node    @relation("EdgeTo", fields: [toId], references: [id])
     toId      Int
     label     String?
   }

   model Plan {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     project   Project @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
     projectId Int     @unique
     content   String  // or Json if you use JSON types
   }
   ```

3. **API Structure Options**: The research details two specific approaches:
   - tRPC approach: Set up routers in src/server/trpc.ts, define protectedProcedure that checks session, then implement endpoints (trpc.router().query('nodes.byProject', {...}))
   - API route approach: e.g. GET /api/projects returns user's projects; POST /api/nodes creates a node (with user/project check)

4. **AI Function Calling Implementation**: The research describes a specific workflow:
   - User asks for a plan
   - Backend sends prompt + function definitions to GPT
   - GPT returns a JSON of parameters
   - Backend processes those parameters (creates plan outline, mermaid code)
   - Optionally sends result back to model for summarization before returning to client

5. **Conversation State Management**: The research recommends "maintaining conversation state in the backend (e.g. conversation table linked to project) for multi-step exchanges" and "caching model responses or using vector stores (e.g. Pinecone) for retrieval if the agent references past data."

6. **Storage Recommendations**: The research suggests:
   - Mermaid diagrams can be stored as "raw code strings or JSON in the Plans or a separate Diagrams table"
   - Business plans can be stored in "JSON or markdown fields (e.g. a JSON column per plan section)"
   - For graph data, use "SQL tables (with Prisma) for most data, but for complex graph traversals a graph DB may be appropriate"

7. **Performance Optimization**: The research specifically suggests:
   - Cache heavy AI results (or run them as async jobs with a queue) to avoid redundant calls
   - Use connection pooling (PgBouncer) for serverless DB connections
   - Enable HTTP caching headers on API responses that don't change often
   - Use lazy-loading in Next.js (code-splitting) for the frontend

## Request
Please enhance my integration plan focusing on the immediate priorities by:

1. Evaluating which authentication approach would be most suitable (Supabase Auth vs NextAuth/Clerk), considering specific security features needed for business planning data

2. Suggesting how to adapt the Prisma schema from the research to work with Supabase or providing a comparative analysis of using Prisma directly with PostgreSQL vs. using Supabase's client

3. Providing a specific implementation plan for OpenAI Function Calling based on the workflow described in the research, with concrete examples of:
   - Function definitions for business plan generation
   - Function definitions for node graph generation
   - Function definitions for Mermaid diagram generation

4. Designing a database schema and API structure specifically optimized for:
   - Storing and retrieving conversation history across different planning sections
   - Efficiently managing the node/edge relationships for visualizations
   - Persisting generated business plans in structured format

5. Detailing a specific implementation strategy for context management between the three different planning sections (Context, Goals, Timelines), including:
   - How to share relevant context between sections
   - How to maintain separate conversation flows
   - How to create unified visualizations from all sections

6. Recommending specific caching strategies for AI responses to improve performance and reduce costs

7. Suggesting the best approach for storing and retrieving Mermaid diagrams and node graphs, with code examples

Please provide a revised integration plan that addresses these immediate priorities while allowing for future expansion. Structure the plan to make quick progress on the core features first. Include specific code examples for key components where possible.

## Specific Technical Questions
1. How should we implement the Nodes/Edges schema from the research to best support our canvas visualization with position data (x, y coordinates) and content?

2. What specific OpenAI function definitions would work best for generating consistent Mermaid diagrams from business planning conversations?

3. How can we effectively design the conversation flow to maintain separate contexts for the three sections while still allowing information to flow between them when needed?

4. What's the most efficient way to cache and reuse AI responses to improve performance while ensuring freshness of data?

5. How should we structure our database queries to efficiently retrieve and render complex node/edge relationships for the canvas visualization?
