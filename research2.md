Enhanced 8gentc Backend & AI Integration Plan
This plan proposes a robust backend architecture with secure auth, structured data models, and AI-driven features using Vercel’s stack. It covers authentication, database design, AI function integration, conversation context, graph schemas, caching, and a step-by-step rollout. Code snippets are provided (using Prisma/TypeScript and Next.js API routes) to illustrate key ideas, with citations for best practices and performance considerations.
1. Authentication Recommendation
Supabase Auth: Provides an all-in-one solution (Auth + Postgres + storage) with built-in features like OAuth, passwordless, MFA, and row-level security (RLS) for fine-grained data control
medium.com
. Supabase’s free tier is generous (50k users/month), and its Auth integrates seamlessly with its Postgres database. RLS can protect business-critical data at the DB level.
medium.com
 Supabase also includes a user-management dashboard and hooks, which speeds up development. The trade-off is less control over the backend (you’re tied to Supabase’s ecosystem) and less polished UI components than Clerk.
NextAuth.js: An open-source, highly flexible auth library for Next.js. It works with any database (can use Supabase/Postgres, etc.) and supports custom providers, JWTs, and refresh tokens. NextAuth gives maximum control but requires building UIs (sign-in pages) and extra config. It’s free and vendor-neutral
medium.com
. However, you must manage secrets, database migrations for session tables, etc.
Clerk: A managed auth service with beautiful pre-built UI components, social logins, SSO, and ready-made user management. It’s fastest to set up (drop-in components)
medium.com
. Clerk handles security and scaling for you, but at the cost of a vendor lock-in and usage-based pricing. You’d still need to store user IDs in your database and secure your data access logic.
Recommendation: For a business-critical planning app, Supabase Auth is often a strong fit if you plan to use Supabase Postgres (taking advantage of RLS and unified dashboard)
medium.com
medium.com
. If you prefer full control or are already using a self-managed DB, NextAuth.js with a Postgres (and Prisma) backend is very flexible. Clerk is ideal if rapid development and UX polish are top priorities (and budget permits), but it’s less open-source and may be overkill if you want tight DB integration. In summary: NextAuth for flexibility, Clerk for ease/UX, Supabase Auth for an integrated “auth+DB” stack

2. Database Strategy & Schema
We recommend a Postgres database with a well-defined schema. You can choose Supabase Postgres (managed with no connection pooling needed thanks to its Data API and PgBouncer)
reddit.com
, or a self-hosted Postgres (e.g. AWS RDS) with Prisma ORM for type-safe queries and migrations.
Proposed Tables/Models
Using Prisma as an ORM (either against Supabase Postgres or a dedicated Postgres), example models might be:
model User {
  id         String    @id @default(uuid())
  email      String    @unique
  name       String?
  projects   Project[]
  createdAt  DateTime  @default(now())
}

model Project {
  id          String     @id @default(uuid())
  user        User       @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId      String
  title       String
  description String?
  createdAt   DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime   @updatedAt
  // Relations to nodes, edges, plans, diagrams, conversations
  nodes       Node[]
  edges       Edge[]
  plans       PlanSection[]
  diagrams    Diagram[]
  conversations Conversation[]
}

model PlanSection {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  project    Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId  String
  section    String   // e.g. "Context", "Goals", "Timeline", etc.
  content    String   // Generated or user-edited plan text
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Node {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  project    Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId  String
  label      String
  content    String?
  type       String   // e.g. "concept", "action", "goal"
  x          Float    // Canvas x-coordinate
  y          Float    // Canvas y-coordinate
  edgesFrom  Edge[]   @relation("EdgeFrom")
  edgesTo    Edge[]   @relation("EdgeTo")
}

model Edge {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  project    Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId  String
  source     Node     @relation("EdgeFrom", fields: [sourceId], references: [id])
  sourceId   String
  target     Node     @relation("EdgeTo", fields: [targetId], references: [id])
  targetId   String
  label      String?
  type       String   // e.g. "dependency", "relates-to"
}

model Diagram {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  project    Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId  String
  type       String   // e.g. "mermaid", "flowchart"
  content    String   // Mermaid code or serialized diagram data
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Conversation {
  id           String    @id @default(uuid())
  project      Project   @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId    String
  section      String    // e.g. "ContextChat", "GoalsChat"
  createdAt    DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime  @updatedAt
  messages     Message[]
}

model Message {
  id             String     @id @default(uuid())
  conversation   Conversation @relation(fields: [conversationId], references: [id])
  conversationId String
  sender         String     // "user" or "assistant"
  content        String
  timestamp      DateTime   @default(now())
}
Users & Projects: Users create or join projects. Each project has metadata and relations to nodes, edges, plan sections, diagrams, and conversations.
PlanSection: Stores generated plan text per section (Context, Goals, Timelines, etc.).
Nodes & Edges: Stores graph nodes with (x,y) positions, labels/types, and directed edges with source/target. This relational model (instead of a monolithic JSON) allows efficient queries and updates.
Diagram: For storing final Mermaid code or other visual outputs, indexed by project.
Conversations/Messages: Each chat section has its own conversation ID, with a list of messages. This lets us replay or analyze chat history.
Relational vs JSON: Supabase (Postgres) inherently supports these relations. You could store nodes/edges as JSON, but using tables avoids heavy JSON manipulation and benefits from indexing. Prisma provides a type-safe query interface.
Supabase vs Self-Managed
Supabase Postgres: Fully managed with auto-scaling, built-in auth, file storage, and a RESTful Data API (PostgREST). Using Supabase means no DB servers to manage, and you get PgBouncer pooling for free (important for serverless)
reddit.com
. Its Data API removes the need to manage connection pooling in functions
reddit.com
vercel.com
. Supabase also has real-time subscriptions (useful if live updates are needed). However, you are tied to their ecosystem (though you can still use Prisma against it) and complexity like custom SQL might be less straightforward.
Self-Managed Postgres + Prisma: Gives full control (choose region, instance size, extensions). Use Prisma for schema migrations and TS type safety. But on Vercel’s serverless functions, you must handle connections carefully (e.g. using pooling libraries or Prisma’s Data Proxy). The Reddit consensus notes that using Prisma with Supabase is common, since Supabase provides a robust Postgres instance with PgBouncer, while Prisma delivers developer ergonomics
reddit.com
. You can even host your Postgres (e.g. Neon or Heroku Postgres) and use Prisma normally; just be sure to implement pooling (or use an HTTP-based proxy like PostgREST/Hasura if available).
Conclusion: For speed and fewer moving parts, Supabase (with Auth + Postgres) is a strong choice
medium.com
reddit.com
. If you need more customization/performance tuning, a dedicated Postgres with Prisma is fine, though expect additional Ops (connection pooling, backups). In either case, design the above schema to capture users, projects, planning content, visuals, and chat history.
3. AI Integration Plan
We'll use OpenAI (GPT-4o or GPT-4) with function calling for structured outputs. Each API call is wrapped in a Next.js serverless API route (Vercel Function), optionally using the Vercel AI SDK to simplify calls and streaming.
Function Calling Definitions
Define JSON schemas for the key AI tasks. These schemas let the model output well-structured JSON.
// 1. Generate a business plan section (text)
const businessPlanSectionFn = {
  name: "generatePlanSection",
  description: "Generate a section of the business plan (e.g. Executive Summary) based on project context and goals.",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      projectId: { type: "string", description: "The ID of the project" },
      section:    { type: "string", description: "The name of the plan section (e.g., 'Context', 'Goals', 'Timeline')" },
      context:    { type: "string", description: "Relevant context or background information from other sections." },
      goals:      { type: "string", description: "Key goals or objectives defined so far." }
    },
    required: ["projectId", "section"]
  }
};

// 2. Generate a node graph (list of nodes and edges)
const nodeGraphFn = {
  name: "generateNodeGraph",
  description: "Generate a concept graph for the project. Returns nodes with (x,y) positions and edges.",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      projectId: { type: "string", description: "The ID of the project" },
      topics:    { type: "array", items: { type: "string" }, description: "Key topics or concepts to include in the graph." }
    },
    required: ["projectId", "topics"]
  }
};

// 3. Generate a Mermaid diagram (flowchart or timeline)
const mermaidDiagramFn = {
  name: "generateMermaidDiagram",
  description: "Generate a Mermaid diagram code (e.g., flowchart) from project timeline or tasks.",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      projectId:    { type: "string", description: "The ID of the project" },
      timelineData: { type: "string", description: "Structured data or bullet points for timeline/tasks." }
    },
    required: ["projectId", "timelineData"]
  }
};
These definitions tell the LLM exactly what JSON structure to return. For example, generateNodeGraph would output something like:
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "n1", "label": "Market Research", "x": 100, "y": 50, "type": "task" },
    { "id": "n2", "label": "Product Idea", "x": 200, "y": 150, "type": "concept" }
    // ...
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "source": "n1", "target": "n2", "label": "informs" }
    // ...
  ]
}
API Routes for AI Calls
Create Next.js API routes (e.g. /api/ai/plan, /api/ai/graph) that:
Accept a request from the frontend with necessary input (project ID, section name, user prompt, etc.).
Call OpenAI’s Chat Completion endpoint with functions: [businessPlanSectionFn, nodeGraphFn, mermaidDiagramFn] and function_call: "auto".
The model will choose a function and return {"name": "...", "arguments": "{...json...}"}.
Parse the JSON from arguments.
Cache or store the result (see section 6) and send it back to the client.
Example using the Vercel AI SDK’s OpenAI provider (in a Next.js API route):
import { OpenAI } from "@vercel/ai";
const openai = new OpenAI({ /* auth config */ });

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { projectId, prompt, currentContext } = await req.json();

  // Send user's prompt and context to the model with function definitions
  const aiResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    functions: [businessPlanSectionFn, nodeGraphFn, mermaidDiagramFn],
    function_call: "auto",
  });

  const message = aiResponse.choices[0].message;
  let resultData = null;

  if (message.function_call) {
    // Parse function output
    resultData = JSON.parse(message.function_call.arguments);
    // e.g. { section: "...", content: "The executive summary is ..."}
  }

  // TODO: cache or persist resultData if needed

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ result: resultData }), { status: 200 });
}
This abstracts the prompt/response cycle. The AI SDK handles streaming and retries if needed. After parsing, you can save the returned JSON into the database (e.g. create PlanSection row, Node/Edge rows, or Diagram record).
Examples
Business Plan Section: Triggered when user asks for a plan section (e.g., “Write the Goals section”). The function outputs text for the section, which you store in PlanSection.content.
Node Graph: When generating a concept map, call generateNodeGraph with key topics. On response, iterate over resultData.nodes/edges and upsert into the Node and Edge tables (with positions and labels).
Mermaid Diagram: Call generateMermaidDiagram to get a string of mermaid code (e.g., a flowchart). Save that code in Diagram.content. The front-end can render it directly.
By using structured function outputs, we ensure consistent JSON that our backend can parse and store reliably, reducing post-processing errors

.
4. Conversation Context Design
To manage multi-section chats (e.g. Context, Goals, Timeline threads), we use separate conversation records but allow selective sharing of insights:
Database Model: Each section chat has its own Conversation entry (with section field). For example: a Conversation with section="Context" and another with section="Goals". The Message table stores individual exchanges. This keeps histories separate and queryable (e.g. fetching only the Timeline chat).
Shared Memory / Insights: We recommend creating a small “project memory” layer. For instance, after completing the Context chat, summarize the key outcomes (in a short memo or tags) and store them (e.g., in Project metadata or a new table ProjectInsight). When starting the Goals chat, preload these insights as system message context. This can be as simple as:
{ "role": "system", "content": "From context conversation: [summarized points]" }
Likewise, when generating Visuals (node graph or timeline), include relevant snippets from all sections.
Syncing Across Sections: You might periodically run an LLM summarizer on all section conversations to extract objectives or constraints. These summaries are then fed into other sections’ prompts. For example, after Context chat, run:
const summary = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [...contextMessages, { role: "user", content: "Summarize the main project goals from above." }],
  model: "gpt-4o"
});
saveToDatabase('Insight', summary.choices[0].message.content);
Then include that summary in the Goals chat context.
Merged Visualization Generation: Even though chats are parallel, the Node/Edge graph or Mermaid diagram should reflect insights from all sections. For example, after finishing Goals and Timeline chats, trigger a call to generate a combined node graph using topics extracted from both. This can be a separate API call that gathers all relevant messages or ProjectInsight entries.
By structuring conversations per section and building a small shared memory (summaries, tags, or vector embeddings if needed), we ensure context flows between sections without mixing chats. The overall UX can still show separate chat tabs (Context, Goals, Timeline) but use shared data when needed for diagrams or plan consistency.
5. Node/Edge Schema Implementation
Nodes and edges (for the concept graph) need to store positional and descriptive data:
Node Model: (As above) each node has id, projectId, label, content (optional detail), type (classification), and coordinates (x, y). These can be floats or integers depending on the canvas resolution. For example:
model Node {
  id        String  @id @default(uuid())
  projectId String
  label     String
  content   String?
  type      String   // e.g. "Concept", "Task", "Goal"
  x         Float
  y         Float
  edgesFrom Edge[]  @relation("EdgeFrom")
  edgesTo   Edge[]  @relation("EdgeTo")
}
Edge Model: Each edge links two nodes with sourceId and targetId foreign keys, plus optional label or type. In the example:
model Edge {
  id        String @id @default(uuid())
  projectId String
  sourceId  String
  targetId  String
  label     String?
  type      String  // e.g. "supports", "blocks"
}
Storage Efficiency: Because graphs can be large, index on projectId and node IDs. Retrieving the whole graph for a project is then a few joins. The Prisma @relation setup (shown above) eases queries. Alternatively, you could store all nodes and edges as JSON in the Diagram table, but splitting into tables allows querying (e.g. find all outgoing edges from a node) and incremental updates (moving one node updates one row).
Visualization Consideration: Store (x,y) so the front-end canvas can position nodes. When generating new nodes via AI, you might let the AI also suggest positions, or auto-place them (e.g., on a grid) if not provided. The function schema above includes x and y so the AI can propose a layout.
Example Insertion (Node Graph): After calling generateNodeGraph, suppose resultData = { nodes: [...], edges: [...] }. In a serverless handler:
for (const node of resultData.nodes) {
  await prisma.node.upsert({
    where: { id: node.id },
    update: { x: node.x, y: node.y, label: node.label, type: node.type },
    create: { id: node.id, projectId, label: node.label, type: node.type, x: node.x, y: node.y }
  });
}
for (const edge of resultData.edges) {
  await prisma.edge.upsert({
    where: { id: `${edge.source}-${edge.target}` },
    update: { label: edge.label, type: edge.type },
    create: { id: `${edge.source}-${edge.target}`, projectId, sourceId: edge.source, targetId: edge.target, label: edge.label, type: edge.type }
  });
}
6. Caching & Performance Optimization
To minimize latency and costs, cache AI outputs and optimize connections:
Prompt/Response Caching: Many AI queries may repeat (e.g. regenerating the same section text). Compute a cache key by hashing the prompt and relevant parameters (model name, section, project ID)
milvus.io
. For instance, sha256(projectId + sectionName + latestContextText). Use a fast cache store like Redis or even a database table with TTL to save the JSON result. On subsequent requests, check cache first and skip the API call if a match is found
milvus.io
. Ensure to include any variable factors (like temperature) in the key. For highly personalized or volatile queries, skip caching.
API Rate Limiting & Throttling: To prevent abuse or overuse of OpenAI, implement rate limiting in your API routes. For example, use Vercel’s Edge Config rules or a middleware library (like express-rate-limit) to cap requests per user or globally. Also monitor OpenAI usage quotas and gracefully handle 429 responses (with exponential backoff).
Connection Pooling: If self-managing Postgres, use serverless-friendly pooling. For example, use Prisma’s Data Proxy or a library like serverless-postgres to reuse connections across invocations
reddit.com
vercel.com
. If on Supabase, prefer using its RESTful Data API or Supabase JS client, which internally handles connection pooling via PgBouncer
reddit.com
. Vercel’s guide recommends using HTTP DB APIs (PostgREST, Hasura) in serverless to avoid traditional pooling issues
vercel.com
reddit.com
.
Queueing for Heavy Tasks: For expensive operations (like generating a large diagram), consider offloading to a background job. You could use Vercel’s Edge Functions for quick runs and maybe Cloudflare Queues or [BullMQ with Redis] as a job queue if needed. However, given Vercel’s generous function timeouts (60s for Pro, 900s for Enterprise), you might handle most tasks in-line. Still, a simple in-memory job queue or using Next.js Middleware can prevent API timeouts.
Database Indexing & Pooling: Index frequently queried fields (userId, projectId). For heavy read operations, consider read replicas. Use Prisma’s built-in caching features (like Redis-based caching for frequently run queries) if read traffic grows. Monitor query performance via Supabase’s dashboard or Postgres logs.
By combining prompt caching and careful pooling, the system will scale to many users while minimizing OpenAI calls and DB overhead
milvus.io
reddit.com
.
7. Data Storage for Visuals
Mermaid Code: Store Mermaid diagram code as text in the Diagram.content field. This allows re-rendering on-demand. You could also version diagrams by saving multiple Diagram rows (with timestamps). Prisma model example:
model Diagram {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  projectId String
  type      String   // e.g. 'flowchart', 'sequence', etc.
  content   String   // e.g. "flowchart LR; A-->B; B-->C;"
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
Query it by project and type to fetch the latest code.
Node/Edge JSON: If you ever need to export or cache the entire graph, you can serialize the nodes/edges from the relational tables into a JSON blob. However, since we have the tables, the front-end can request /api/project/{id}/graph which joins Node and Edge and returns { nodes: [...], edges: [...] }. This avoids storing JSON redundantly.
Example Prisma models: (Refer to section 2 schema above for Node, Edge, Diagram.)
Supabase Tables: If using Supabase without Prisma, the tables would mirror these models. Use Supabase migrations or the SQL editor to define tables with columns (id UUID primary key, x float8, etc.) and foreign key constraints. Enable RLS policies so users only see their own projects (e.g., user_id = auth.uid() in policies).
File Storage (optional): If diagrams need attachments (PNG exports?), use Supabase Storage or an S3 bucket. Otherwise, storing text code and letting the client render it (via a Mermaid library) is sufficient.
8. Quick Start Implementation Plan
A phased rollout can help get functionality online quickly:
Set Up Auth & DB:
Provision Supabase or Postgres. If Supabase, enable Auth and create initial tables via the GUI or SQL. If self-hosted, set up a Postgres instance.
Initialize Prisma (or Supabase migrations) with the schema above. Run migrations.
Implement user sign-up/login flows. For NextAuth, configure providers and session storage; for Supabase Auth, integrate the Supabase JS client. Secure all API routes (check session or JWT) so only authorized users access data.
Implement Core Models & APIs:
Create basic CRUD APIs for Projects and PlanSections (e.g. GET /api/projects, POST /api/project, GET /api/project/[id]).
Implement database hooks or middleware (using Prisma or Supabase RLS) to enforce that users can only read/write their own projects.
Test saving and fetching project data in the frontend (simple form or list).
Add AI Chat Endpoints:
Build API routes for AI calls (e.g. /api/ai/context, /api/ai/goals, /api/ai/timeline). Each route wraps a call to openai.chat.completions.create with the above function definitions.
On first call, skip function calling and just echo dummy response to establish UI flow.
Once working, integrate actual OpenAI calls. Return the parsed JSON or text to the client.
For example, /api/ai/generate-plan might accept { projectId, section } and call businessPlanSectionFn.
Store AI Outputs:
When AI returns a plan section or diagram, save it to the DB (e.g. update PlanSection.content or insert into Diagram). Implement this in the API route before sending response.
Cache outputs: implement a simple key-value store (Redis, or even a Prisma “Cache” table) to remember recent prompts. For example:
model AiCache {
  key       String   @id
  response  String   // JSON or text
  updatedAt DateTime @default(now()) @updatedAt
}
Use prisma.aiCache.upsert before calling OpenAI.
Chat UIs and Context Flow:
In the frontend, build chat interfaces for each section. Save messages to Conversation and Message tables via API calls (POST /api/chat/message).
After each chat exchange, optionally trigger a background summarization of the conversation and save to Project or an Insight table.
Ensure context is included: when the user types in the Goals chat, first fetch relevant context from DB (Context chat summary and any goal inputs) and include as system message.
Node/Edge Editor:
Integrate a JS graph library (like React Flow or Cytoscape) in the frontend. On a user action (e.g. “Generate Concept Map”), call /api/ai/graph with topics.
On response, create Node and Edge records. Populate the graph UI from the database.
Enable user edits: dragging a node updates its x,y, editing labels updates content in DB (sync back with Prisma).
Mermaid Diagrams:
For timeline or process visualizations, add a button “Generate Flowchart”. The frontend sends timeline data to /api/ai/diagram.
Save the returned Mermaid code in Diagram.content. On the client, render it with a library like @mermaid-js/react.
Testing & Iteration:
Continuously test each piece: auth flows, data saving, AI outputs, conversation linking.
Monitor performance: use logs or Supabase dashboard to track slow queries.
Tune caching TTLs and OpenAI parameters (e.g. temperature=0.7 for creativity in diagrams, 0.3 for consistency in plans).
Throughout development, leverage Vercel’s built-in monitoring and Supabase’s query logs to spot issues. Keep schemas flexible (Prisma migrations) as you discover new data needs (e.g. tagging nodes with categories). Performance & Extensibility: This architecture separates concerns (auth, data, AI), making it scalable. You can later add features like real-time collaboration (using Supabase real-time), vector embeddings (for advanced memory), or alternative AI providers via the Vercel SDK. Caching and pooling measures ensure the app scales under load
milvus.io
reddit.com
. By following these steps and using the designs above, you’ll have a secure, extensible backend that powers the 8gentc platform’s AI planning features with full data persistence and structure.
