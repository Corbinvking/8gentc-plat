8gentc Backend Architecture & Implementation Guide
Tech Stack & Authentication: For a robust and modern backend we recommend a Node.js environment (Next.js API or serverless functions) with TypeScript. Use a proven authentication library (like NextAuth.js/Auth.js or Clerk) to handle sign-ups, logins, and sessions securely
nextjs.org
. For example, many Next.js apps combine Clerk or NextAuth for auth, Prisma ORM for a Postgres database, and tRPC (with TanStack Query) for type-safe APIs

. This stack provides built-in session management (JWT or cookie sessions) and supports features like OAuth/Social login and role-based access without reinventing the wheel. You’d store user credentials and session info in the database (or via the auth provider), while using middleware or route guards to protect API endpoints. By relying on these libraries, you get MFA and security best practices out-of-the-box

. An ORM like Prisma handles data access, and an auth library manages login and sessions. Data Modeling & Storage: Create database tables (or models) for the core entities: Users, Projects, Nodes, Edges, and Plans/Diagrams. For example, a relational schema might include:
sql
Copy
Edit
Users(id, email, passwordHash, name, createdAt);
Projects(id, ownerId → Users.id, title, description, createdAt);
Nodes(id, projectId → Projects.id, content, xPos, yPos);
Edges(id, projectId → Projects.id, fromNodeId → Nodes.id, toNodeId → Nodes.id, label);
Plans(id, projectId → Projects.id, content TEXT);  -- or JSON for structured plan sections
In Next.js/Prisma syntax, Node and Edge models would mirror this. In practice, store each node/vertex in one table and edges (with from/to foreign keys) in another
stackoverflow.com
. This lets the frontend reconstruct the graph. Mermaid diagrams (text-based flowcharts) can be stored as raw code strings or JSON in the Plans or a separate Diagrams table so the frontend can render/update them. Business plans or structured documents can be stored in JSON or markdown fields (e.g. a JSON column per plan section). For small-to-medium scale, Postgres (with JSONB columns if needed) works well. If graph queries become heavy, you can also consider a graph database (Neo4j or Dgraph) as an alternative
stackoverflow.com
 – these natively treat nodes/edges as first-class. For example, Neo4j AuraDB (cloud graph DB) can store nodes and relationships with labels, which is natural for knowledge graphs. In summary: use SQL tables (with Prisma) for most data, but for complex graph traversals a graph DB may be appropriate. API Layer (REST/tRPC): Expose backend logic via API routes or an RPC layer. With Next.js, you can use App Router route handlers (app/api/...) or the Pages router (pages/api) for REST endpoints, or integrate tRPC for type-safe RPC calls. For example, define tRPC procedures like project.list, project.create, graph.getNodes, graph.addEdge, etc., which handle validation and call database queries. This provides end-to-end TypeScript safety between frontend and backend

. Alternatively, a lightweight REST/JSON API (e.g. /api/projects GET/POST) is fine. In either case, secure the routes by checking the authenticated session and project ownership. Use input validation (e.g. Zod schemas) to enforce structure on incoming data. For example:
tRPC approach: set up routers in src/server/trpc.ts, define protectedProcedure that checks session, then implement endpoints (trpc.router().query('nodes.byProject', {...})).
API route approach: e.g. GET /api/projects returns user’s projects from DB; POST /api/nodes creates a node (with user/project check).
Whether REST or RPC, handle data in JSON and return structured JSON. Cache frequently-read responses (e.g. project graph JSON) and paginate lists if large. AI Model Integration: Integrate OpenAI (or similar LLM) calls in your server code to generate structured content. For example, when a user requests a business plan or graph generation, send a prompt to the OpenAI API from a server function. Use Function Calling to have the model output structured JSON for easier handling
vercel.com
. A typical flow is: user asks for a plan; backend sends the prompt plus function definitions to GPT; GPT returns a JSON of parameters; backend executes or processes those parameters (e.g. creates plan outline, mermaid code); then optionally sends the result back to the model for summarization before returning to client
vercel.com
. This approach ensures consistent output formats (like JSON with keys) that your app can store directly. Manage API keys via environment variables. For planning flows (iterative prompts), maintain conversation state in the backend (e.g. conversation table linked to project) if you want to allow multi-step exchanges. Also consider caching model responses or using vector stores (e.g. Pinecone) for retrieval if the agent references past data. But at minimum, call the LLM from server side and save the outputs (graphs, plan text) in the database so they persist. Collaboration & Real-Time (Future): To enable multi-user collaboration and live updates, plan for real-time features. One approach is to integrate WebSockets (e.g. Socket.IO) in an API route
medium.com
. For instance, spin up a Socket.IO server inside pages/api/socket.js or a custom Next.js server, allowing connected clients to broadcast node/edge updates or chat messages in real time. The client subscribes to project channels and receives live changes. Alternatively, use a real-time database like Supabase’s Realtime or Firebase Firestore with their SDKs for pub/sub on table changes. For now, you can store a project_members table (userId, projectId, role) to support future shared editing. Implement row-level security or permission checks so only invited collaborators see a project’s data. As a simple first step, emitting update events over WebSockets and letting the frontend merge changes (with a library like Yjs for CRDT syncing) can achieve live collaboration

. Scalability & Deployment: Deploy the backend as serverless functions or containerized services. Next.js API routes on Vercel or AWS Lambda will auto-scale with demand
blog.pixelfreestudio.com
. Use CDNs for any static assets and enable HTTP caching headers on API responses that don’t change often. Ensure database can scale (e.g. managed Postgres with read replicas). Implement connection pooling (PgBouncer) for serverless DB connections. Cache heavy AI results (or run them as async jobs with a queue) to avoid redundant calls. Monitor performance and use lazy-loading in Next.js (code-splitting) for the frontend. In short, follow Next.js best practices: use incremental static regeneration or caching where possible, deploy API routes as lambda functions, and rely on managed DB services. These choices ensure high availability and performance as user count grows

. Example Database Schema (Prisma):
prisma
Copy
Edit
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  projects  Project[]
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

model Project {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  owner     User    @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
  ownerId   Int
  title     String
  nodes     Node[]
  edges     Edge[]
  plan      Plan?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

model Node {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  project   Project @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId Int
  label     String
  x         Float?
  y         Float?
  // other properties...
}

model Edge {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  project   Project @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId Int
  from      Node    @relation("EdgeFrom", fields: [fromId], references: [id])
  fromId    Int
  to        Node    @relation("EdgeTo", fields: [toId], references: [id])
  toId      Int
  label     String?
}

model Plan {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  project   Project @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  projectId Int     @unique
  content   String  // or Json if you use JSON types
}
This schema (and similar relational tables) satisfies persistent projects and graphs. Each user’s data persists across sessions, and can later be shared with other users. In summary, combine Next.js backend (API routes or tRPC) + Postgres+Prisma + NextAuth/Clerk + WebSockets/Realtime, and integrate OpenAI calls on the server. This fulfills all requirements with modern best practices (type safety, security, scalability)
